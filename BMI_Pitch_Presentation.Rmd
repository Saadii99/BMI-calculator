## Slide 1: Introduction

Welcome to the BMI Calculator App presentation.

This app helps users determine their Body Mass Index based on their height and weight inputs.

---

## Slide 2: App Features

- Accepts user input: Height (cm) and Weight (kg)
- Calculates BMI reactively
- Displays a message indicating health status:
  - Underweight
  - Normal
  - Overweight
  - Obese

---

## Slide 3: How It Works

**Formula Used:**

$$ BMI = \frac{weight(kg)}{(height(m))^2} $$

The app uses this formula inside a reactive function to update results in real-time as the user inputs change.

---

## Slide 4: Sample Calculation (R code)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
height_cm <- 170
weight_kg <- 65
height_m <- height_cm / 100
bmi <- weight_kg / (height_m ^ 2)
bmi
```

This calculates BMI for a person who is 170 cm tall and weighs 65 kg.
